### 👋 Hi, I’m @mpeyfuss
I'm an engineer and founder, working at the intersection of art and technology 🎨

### A bit about me 👀
- ⚙️ I hold a Bachelor's of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, specialized in vehicle control systems.
- 🚗 After university, I worked for Honda R&D in a satellite office researching engine emissions.
- 🛰️ I then worked as a test engineer for a small robotics company writing test automation software for satelitte actuators.
- 📄 Eventually, my best friend conviced me to check out smart contracts & NFTs on Ethereum.
- 💡 Something clicked and I was hooked. I could see new ways to unlock creativity, specifically around ownable digital objects.
- 🛠️ That's how I founded Transient Labs and started building my own company alongside my friends.
- 🎨 I'm no artist, but I know how to work with aritsts to create one of a kind experiences.
- 📢 I tend to stay behind the scenes and let my work do the talking for me.
- ❤️ I'm passionate about the intersection of art and technology, smart contracts, and building things.

### Building Ideology 🪛
- I like batteries included frameworks. I just want to build things critical to the business, not reinvent the wheel.
- The more time I can save from debating decisions, the more effective I am to the business.
- I build things to last. Sometimes a quick solution is needed, but it needs to last for whatever timeline is needed, multiplied by 2.
- Smart contracts are pieces of hardware. Once launched, they can't be fixed, so build it properly the first time.
- If it works, it's not bad code. Function over style.
