### 👋 Hi, I’m @mpeyfuss
I'm an engineer and founder building cool shit.

### A bit about me 👀
- My background in is mechanical engineering, specifically vehicle and satelitte testing.
- I got into writing smart contracts on Ethereum in 2021. I was hooked instantly. Sovereign digital objects are amazing.
- I love working with artists, bringing technology in to bring more meaning to their work.

### Building Ideology 🪛
- Smart contracts are pieces of hardware. Once launched, they can't be fixed, so build it properly the first time.
- I like batteries included frameworks. I want to build things critical to the business, not reinvent the wheel.
- The more time I can save from debating decisions, the more effective I am to the business.
- I build things to last and pass the walk-away test.
